Matthew's Notes - Trigrid HW
============================

1. Browse documentation and website.  Generate time estimate.
2. Download fish example, didn't work.
3. Download simple line-drawing example.  Get it to work locally.  Yay!
4. Change one parameter in simple line-drawing example.  It behaves the way I thought it would. Yay!
5. Make more small changes.
6. Write small program: each time the user clicks, draw a line between the previous mouse click location and the current mouse click location.
7. Draw a series of parallel vertical lines, each line the same distance from its neighbors. (First time using a loop.)
8. Draw all the background lines, using coordinate transformation and loops and a low alpha value.
9. Draw an equilateral triangle.  (Don't worry about matching it to the grid.)
10. Draw the background lines, one triangle at a time.

Design Decisions
================

Optimize for: 
- YAGNI (build what's needed, anticipate reasonable extensions but don't build anything beyond what the design spec calls for.).  No premature optimization.  (GUI should be "reasonably" responsive, but don't stress too much about optimization.  On the first pass, just get it working so you can get some feedback.)
- Readability/maintainability and performance.
- Try to keep the setup time manageable, but don't worry if it takes a second or two to load.  Once it's loaded, the GUI should be very responsive. (No noticeable delay for user.)
- Programmer time.

False start: draw background lines in a separate pass.
Other options:
- hard-code a background image.  Very fast load time but this is brittle - can't resize canvas or change line color.

Hard-coding triangles because there are only a few ways to tile the plane with regular polygons and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to switch between them.

Should use objects/encapsulation for triangles.

GUI should work with partial triangles.

"Edge case" - When user clicks on a triangle edge, arbitrarily choose one adjacent triangle to toggle color.

Faint line may or may not show up when a colored triangle is next to a background triangle.

Known issues
============
Clicking on triangles along the right-hand or bottom edges is buggy or inconsistent.  (Colors the wrong triangle, or does no action.)
Sometimes shows a faint border between adjacent triangles with the same color.
